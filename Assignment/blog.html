			<h1>Phase-1</h1>
			For the assignment first I read the brief carefully. Then, there was the discussion class for the assignment. In the class our module leader cleared all our doubts for the assignment. After that I started working on the backed of the website. First, I created the index.html page which I kept it simple with just welcome text. After index page I moved onto portfolio page. In that page  there are placeholder images. After creating index and portfolio I worked on the blog page which was little confusing to me. I had to discuss that with my module leader as I was not sure what to do exactly on that page. After discussing it was quite clear to me how to work on that page. So, at first I just created three entries with some of the random texts. Then I started working on the contact page where I created a form for registration along with my contact information.

			<h1>Phase-2</h1>
			On the second phase for the assignment there was the last page which need to be created and that was report page. On this page I had to conclude everything about the assignment. Then I decided to do that at last of the assignment after completing the assignment. After that I started working on the navigation bar for the website. I also changed and updated different things throughout the process of developing the  website.

        <div><h1>Phase-3</h1>
			This is the last part of the assignment. In this page I first worked on the .css part of the website to make couple of changes and updating the UI of the website. After that I worked on the responsive part of the assignment. I started looking for the background images for the pages. After finding the suitable background image I kept the same image for all the pages. After completing all other necessary task for the website, I completed the report page by including all the thing there. After report page I completed my blog page which I left incomplete. In blog page I created three phases of my working process on the website. After completing blog page, I updated the screenshot images of website development process on the report page. After completing all the thing, I made video demonstration of the website and uploaded my assignment.
